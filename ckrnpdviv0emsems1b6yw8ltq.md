## How To Host a static website in AWS S3 bucket and mapped to a custom domain with Godaddy

### S3 - What Is It?



- 
Amazon S3 is object storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. Itâ€™s a simple storage service that offers industry leading durability, availability, performance, security, and virtually unlimited scalability at very low costs.



- 
The S3 in Amazon S3 stands for Simple Storage Service. As the name implies it is a web service provided by Amazon Web Services which provides storage for the internet. This storage is highly-scalable and secure in the cloud. Having data stored in the cloud eliminates the need for in-house storage and customers can opt for unlimited storage or buy more as it is needed. 


- 
S3 is an incredibly helpful product which allows users to store and retrieve data from anywhere on the web, at any time. This is done though the AWS Management Console which is an easy to use web interface.


- 
Amazon itself uses S3 to run its own websites across the world. It has become extremely popular and is growing at an exponential rate.


- 
In 2007 S3 stored ten billion objects and this has soared to two trillion objects in 2013. Just a few of the well known companies that use S3 are Netflix, Dropbox, Pinterest and Tumblr.
