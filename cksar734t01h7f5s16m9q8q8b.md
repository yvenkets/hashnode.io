### **Available Features**
Big Blue Button contains all of the standard features one would expect from a video conferencing solution. The ability to share video and audio inputs as well as the ability to conduct presentations with a whiteboard functionality that allows for pointers and zooming as well as screen sharing. There are also text-based chat rooms that can be created in both public and private formats. And since BBB uses a pure HTML 5 client, the software can be used in most common web browsers available today. For these reasons, BBB is the obvious choice for users looking for an open source comprehensive video conferencing solution.
